  The goal of this project is code refactoring to make it more efficient and maintainable! We will create smaller, more manageable components to render a list of movies by genre.
</p>

## :sparkles: Features

* The application has only one main feature, which is the movie listing;
* In the sidebar, it is possible to select which category of movies should be listed;
* The first category in the list (which is "Action") should already start as marked;
* The application's header only has the name of the selected category that must dynamically change.
